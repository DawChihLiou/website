            We found that this project is attracting a lot of engineers that
            care about code-quality and solid engineering standards. We think
            this is a great opportunity to advertise solid analysis tools and
            workshops to a professional target audience.
          </p>

            <b>
              That's why we are currently looking for partners who want to
              sponsor hosting and development of the project.

          <p tw="mb-3">
            We believe that this project should be completely open to avoid bias
            and gatekeepers, which promote tools purely based on monetary interest and
            not on quality. Since we want this to be a community project
            and the code/assets be freely available to everyone, we’ll use
            Github Sponsors + Open Collective for funding.
